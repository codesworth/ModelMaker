# ModelMaker
ModelMaker is a commandline Application that enables quick and automated generation of Swift classes, properties and files on the go.

The Big IDEA
Swif is a revolutionary modern language and it use keeps extending to all Areas. The issue i encounter daily with writing Swift Code in Xcode is the chore of generating files using the standard procedure and having to define class names, properties, setters and getters, file ascessors and encapsulation. ModelMaker is created to make this chore simpler by simply typing out most relevant parts of creating a class such as classname, property names and using some reserved keywords to generate a complete formatted swift class file.
